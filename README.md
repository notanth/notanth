- 👋 Hi, I’m @notanth or Ant(h) for short;
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code and developing my skills (web dev first) so I can freelance/work in open source and get a JS/full stack role down the road; 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: mostly web dev (I'm working through courses such as the Odin Project, freecodecamp, and Scrimba) but my goal is to get to a place where I can build full stack web apps..
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects & open source and learn (build) in public...
- 📫 How to reach me: here, twitter (@not_anth)
