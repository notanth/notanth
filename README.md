- 👋 Hi, I’m @notanth or Ant(h) for short;
- 👀 I’m interested in web frameworks, all things python, tech, and so on, so I can work in web development/SaaS, whether it be on my own projects/in a dev role/supporting tech teams from the finance, data, FP&A side of the business
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Python, Django, etc 
- 💞️ I’m looking to build my own microSaaS...
