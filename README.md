- 👋 Hi, I’m @notanth or Ant(h) for short;
- 👀 I’m interested in web development, all things python, and new frameworks and tools so I can work in web development/on a SaaS product, whether it be on my own projects/in a dev role/supporting tech teams from the finance, data, FP&A side of the business.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Python, Django, HTMX.
- 💞️ I’m looking to build my own microSaaS and landing a dev role!
- 📫 How to reach me: here, twitter (@not_anth)
